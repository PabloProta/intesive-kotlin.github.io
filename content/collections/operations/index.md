# 👋 Welcome to the world of Kotlin collections operations! 
If you're working with Kotlin collections, you'll be happy to know that Kotlin comes with a wide range of built-in functions and methods for manipulating collections.

 **📜 Lists, sets, and maps are the main types of collections in Kotlin, and each type has its own set of functions and methods for working with them. Here are some of the most commonly used operations:**

### 📋 List operations:

>
  - **add**: adds an element to the end of the list
  - **remove**: removes the first occurrence of a given element from the list
  - **size**: returns the number of elements in the list
  - **get**: returns the element at the specified index
  - **indexOf**: returns the index of the first occurrence of a given element in the list

### 🔍 Set operations:

> 
  - **add**: adds an element to the set
  - **remove**: removes a given element from the set
  - **contains**: returns true if the set contains a given element
  - **size**: returns the number of elements in the set
  - **union**: returns a new set that contains all the elements from two sets

### 🗺️ Map operations:

>
  - **put**: associates a given value with a given key in the map
  - **get**: returns the value associated with a given key in the map
  - **containsKey**: returns true if the map contains a given key
  - **size**: returns the number of key-value pairs in the map
  - **keys**: returns a set of all the keys in the map


🤖 In addition to these basic operations, there are also many higher-order functions that can be used to transform, filter, and manipulate collections in more complex ways. Here are some examples:

> 
  - **map**: transforms each element in a collection and returns a new collection with the results
  - **filter**: returns a new collection that contains only the elements that match a given condition
  - **reduce**: applies a given operation to all the elements in a collection and returns a single result
  - **groupBy**: groups elements in a collection by a given key

🎉 With all these operations at your fingertips, you'll be a Kotlin collections wizard in no time! So go forth and explore the wonderful world of Kotlin collections. 🚀
