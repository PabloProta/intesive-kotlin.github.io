# Linear Structures

- **Linear data structure**: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
> Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
    - **Static data structure**: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
An example of this data structure is an array.
    - **Dynamic data structure**: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
> Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.
