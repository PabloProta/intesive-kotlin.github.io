# Non-Linear Structures

- **Non-linear data structure**: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
>Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs
