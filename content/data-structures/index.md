# Data Structures

## What's?
In computer science, a data structure refers to a way of organizing and storing data in a computer program so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently.

To understand this concept in everyday terms, let's consider the example of organizing a wardrobe.

Imagine you have a large wardrobe with clothes of different types: shirts, pants, dresses, and so on. If you simply dump all the clothes into the wardrobe, it would be difficult to find what you need when you want it. However, if you organize the clothes by type (shirts in one drawer, pants in another, etc.), it becomes much easier to locate and retrieve specific items quickly.

Similarly, in a computer program, data can be stored in various ways depending on the type of data and the specific needs of the program. For example, a list might be used to store a collection of items that need to be accessed sequentially, while a hash table might be used to store key-value pairs that need to be looked up quickly. By using appropriate data structures, the program can access and manipulate data more efficiently, just as organizing a wardrobe makes it easier to find and use your clothes.
