# Data Structures

## What's?
In computer science, a data structure refers to a way of organizing and storing data in a computer program so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently.

To understand this concept in everyday terms, let's consider the example of organizing a wardrobe.

Imagine you have a large wardrobe with clothes of different types: shirts, pants, dresses, and so on. If you simply dump all the clothes into the wardrobe, it would be difficult to find what you need when you want it. However, if you organize the clothes by type (shirts in one drawer, pants in another, etc.), it becomes much easier to locate and retrieve specific items quickly.

Similarly, in a computer program, data can be stored in various ways depending on the type of data and the specific needs of the program. For example, a list might be used to store a collection of items that need to be accessed sequentially, while a hash table might be used to store key-value pairs that need to be looked up quickly. By using appropriate data structures, the program can access and manipulate data more efficiently, just as organizing a wardrobe makes it easier to find and use your clothes.

## Classification of Data Structure:

- **Linear data structure**: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
> Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
    - **Static data structure**: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
An example of this data structure is an array.
    - **Dynamic data structure**: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
> Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.
- **Non-linear data structure**: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
>Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs
